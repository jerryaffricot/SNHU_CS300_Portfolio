# Course Planner

The project requirements were to choose the appropriate data structure to hold course information from a csv file, 
display the courses in order and search for a specific course. The data structures to choose from were limited to 
a vector, a binary search tree, and an hash table.Data structures are extremely useful at grouping elements that 
are related to each other. The data structure for a program should be chosen based on the runtime performance 
and memory allocation needed to satisfy the requirements. The data structure also impacts the algorithms that can be used. 
For example, insertion and selection sort can not be used on a binary tree because the tree does not allow random access.

I mostly used lists and maps to store elements because they are simple and fast to implement and they don't require much memory space 
to hold the elements. Now I will incorporate runtime analysis while choosing a data structure or the algorithm that can be performed 
to satisfy the project's requirements.
